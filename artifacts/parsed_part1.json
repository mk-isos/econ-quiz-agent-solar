발행회사가 보유하는 교환대상 유가증권은 상장유가증<br>권으로 제한되고 있으며 증권예탁원에 의무적으로 예탁되어야 한다. 투자자는 미래의<br>주식가격 상승에 따른 시세차익을 기대할 수 있고 발행회사는 낮은 이자율로 사채를<br>발행하여 금융비용 부담을 덜 수 있어 회사채 발행을 통한 기업자금조달을 촉진할<br>수 있는 장점이 있다. 반면에 투자자의

직접세라고 하며, 대표적인 예로는<br>소득세, 법인세, 상속세, 증여세, 종합부동산세 등이 있다. 이와 달리 납세의무자와 조세부<br>담자가 일치하지 않고 조세의 부담이 타인에게 전가되는 세금을 간접세라고 하며, 대표적<br>인 예로는 부가가치세, 개별소비세, 주세, 인지세, 증권거래세 등이 있다. 간접세는 조세에<br>대한 저항이 적고 징수가 간편하여 조세수입의 확보가 용이하다는 장점이 있다. 반면,<br>개인의 사정을 고려할 수 없으므로 누진세율(累進税率)을 적용하지 못하고 비례세율이<br>적용됨으로써 소득이 적은 자에게 상대적으로 높은 조세부담률이 적용되는 역진성(逆進<br>性)을 띠게 되어 공평부담의 원칙에 어긋난다는 단점이 있다. 한편, 국민계정체계에서는<br>조세의 실질적인 부담주체를 결정하기가 쉽지 않은 점 등을 감안하여 간접세와 직접세<br>대신 생산 및 수입세, 소득 및 부 등에 대한 경상세, 자본세란 용어를 사용하고
